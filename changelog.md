  -  Added datasource configuration option to deallocate dataset on ITM/APM server after every metric query. It is highly recommended to have it enabled all the time. Lack of datasource deallocation requests may cause memory leak and OutOfMemory exceptions on ITM/APM server. This plugin update requires also change in the Grafana server backend. See updated installation instructions and datasource configuration for details.

  -  UTC time zone offset option for ITMv6 HUB TEMS in the datasource configuration. Change the default settings only if HUB TEMS is located in non UTC time zone **and** you access Grafana dashboard from the timezone different than your HUB TEMS - in that case set UTC offset to HUB TEMS time zone.
